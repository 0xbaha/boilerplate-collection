# Boilerplate Collection

A curated collection of reusable boilerplate templates for various development tasks, designed to save time and ensure consistency.

## Overview

This repository serves as a central place for various boilerplate files and template structures commonly used in software development and project setup. The goal is to provide ready-to-use starting points for files like script headers, configuration files, documentation structures, and more, helping you jumpstart your work and maintain standard practices across projects.

## Motivation

-   **Save Time:** Avoid rewriting common files or structures from scratch.
-   **Ensure Consistency:** Promote standardized formats and essential information within files.
-   **Best Practices:** Offer templates incorporating good practices (e.g., comprehensive script headers, standard `.gitignore` files).
-   **Easy Access:** Provide a single location to find and retrieve common boilerplate code and documentation.

## How to Use

There are several ways to use the templates in this collection:

1.  **Copy & Paste:**
    *   Navigate to the template file you need within the repository on GitHub.
    *   Click the "Raw" button to view the raw file content.
    *   Copy the content and paste it into a new file in your own project.
    *   **Important:** Remember to fill in any placeholders with your specific project details.

2.  **Download Files:**
    *   Use tools like `curl` or `wget` to download specific files directly. Replace `[path/to/template.ext]` with the actual path in the repository.
      ```
      # Example using curl
      curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xbaha/boilerplate-collection/main/[path/to/template.ext]

      # Example using wget
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xbaha/boilerplate-collection/main/[path/to/template.ext]
      ```
    *   Remember to replace `0xbaha` with your actual GitHub username if you fork this repository, or the original owner's username if using theirs.

3.  **Use as a GitHub Template Repository:**
    *   If enabled (repository maintainer can do this in settings), you can click the "Use this template" button near the top of the repository page on GitHub.
    *   This will create a new repository in your account, pre-populated with all the files from this collection, which you can then modify as needed.
